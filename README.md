This is a program created in Python to scan 4 Julia Test files and interpret them. 
> The given text file will first be scanned using the scanner class and broken down into tokens. 
> These tokens will then be sent to a syntax analyzer and checked to make sure they follow the predefined syntax rules for the language. 
> Given no syntax errors occur, the program will then execute the Julia file statement by statement using the functionality provided in the Python langauge.

NOTE: minimalistic error detection and error handling is implemented at every step of the process.
